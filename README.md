# node-poe-parse

Personal project for seeing value changes due to upgrades in POE

Project has two parts. 

Frontend UI using VueJS built with webpack.

Found at /node-poe-parse/UI

Run "npm run dev" to use live edit. Run "npm run prod" to build minified prod version.

Backend serves a RESTful API that shows some pre-scraped data as well as pull live data from external API. Also has the ability to add new data and save it on disk.

Run "npm start" to start backend service.

Code is unmaintained.
